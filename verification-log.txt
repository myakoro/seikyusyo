(node:10060) [MODULE_TYPELESS_PACKAGE_JSON] Warning: Module type of file:///C:/Users/takuy/Desktop/%E8%AB%8B%E6%B1%82%E6%9B%B8%E7%99%BA%E8%A1%8C%E3%82%B7%E3%82%B9%E3%83%86%E3%83%A0/verification-script.ts is not specified and it doesn't parse as CommonJS.
Reparsing as ES module because module syntax was detected. This incurs a performance overhead.
To eliminate this warning, add "type": "module" to C:\Users\takuy\Desktop\請求書発行システム\package.json.
(Use `node --trace-warnings ...` to show where the warning was created)
